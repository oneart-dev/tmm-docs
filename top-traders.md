# Top traders <a target="_blank" href="https://tradermake.money/app2/account/top-traders" class="btn btn-header">Go to Top Traders</a>

Here are several reasons why participating in the top traders can be beneficial
for you:

1. **Visibility and Recognition:** Being featured on a "Top Traders" page
   enhances a trader's visibility in the financial community. It serves as a
   form of recognition for their expertise and successful trading strategies,
   which can boost their reputation.
2. **Networking Opportunities:** Such a page often attracts other skilled
   traders and industry professionals, providing valuable networking
   opportunities. This can lead to collaborations, knowledge exchange, and even
   potential business partnerships.
3. **Attracting Clients and Investors:** For traders who manage funds or seek
   investment, being listed as a top trader can attract clients and investors.
   It serves as a testament to their skill and reliability, thereby increasing
   their credibility in the eyes of potential investors.
4. **Motivation and Benchmarking:** Being among top traders provides a benchmark
   for success and can be highly motivating. It encourages continuous
   improvement and adaptation of strategies to maintain or improve one's
   position on the list.

## Leagues

The top traders are divided into 2 leagues:

- **Open League** with open access. Any trader can participate in this league.
- **PRO League**. Traders who go through a 3-week selection period can enter
  this league. [More details](#how-to-get-into-the-pro-league).

Each league has two rankings: Top of the Day and Top of the Month.

## Victory and Prizes

Throughout the day/month, you see the current values of traders (the top updates
once an hour). At the end of the day (UTC time zone), the results of the Top of
the Day are summarized. At the end of the last day of the month, the result of
the Top of the Month is calculated.

Prizes are awarded for 1st to 3rd places. Winning the Top of the Day will earn
you an achievement in your public profile. Winning the Top of the Month gets you
a one-month subscription extension or the Trader tariff for a month if you don't
have an active subscription.

## How to Get into the PRO League?

First thing to note: Entry into the PRO League is entirely automatic. You don't
need to adjust or change your trading in any way.

### 3-Week Selection and Stars

At the end of each week, the system reviews your trading, and if all criteria
are met, you receive 1 star. If the criteria are not met, the star is removed if
you had one previously.

To enter the PRO League, you need to accumulate 3 stars.

### Staying in the PRO League

Once you're in the PRO League, the system will continue to evaluate your trading
every week. If the criteria are not met, you will lose 1 star. Once you lose all
3 stars, you will automatically leave the PRO League, and the entire process
starts over.

This system allows you to take a break from trading for a couple of weeks
without losing your league status.

## How is the Top Traders Ranking Calculated?

In short, the percentage indicates how much a trader's deposit has grown over a
period (Top of the Day - for the current day UTC, Top of the Month - for the
current month).

### Mechanism for Calculating Percentages

Percentages are calculated cumulatively in this case. This is best illustrated
with an example:

- Initial deposit: $100.
- Trade A: +$10 = +10% to the deposit.
- Trade B: +$10 = +9% to the deposit (because the deposit increased to $110).
- Total percentage: +19%

## Why am I not in the Top?

There can be several reasons why you are not in the top traders:

1. The top has not updated yet. The top updates every hour, so if you just
   connected, it's worth waiting.
2. You are not participating in the top traders. To participate, you need to
   enable your public profile and join the top traders. Choose your active API
   key and save.
3. You just added an API key. Only trades opened after adding the API key to our
   service participate in the top traders.
4. Insufficient increase in the deposit. Keep in mind that only closed trades
   participate in the top traders. Floating profit is not considered, only fixed
   profit.
