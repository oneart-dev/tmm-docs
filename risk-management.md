to specific trading boundaries, ensuring disciplined trading practices.

## Creating Risk Management Rules

- **Customizable Rules**: Set personalized rules for maximum loss per trade, per
  day, and maximum leverage for each API key.
- **Proactive Notifications**: Get alerted through Telegram if any rule is
  violated, provided you're connected to our bot.
- **Deposit-Based Calculations**: All risk management values are calculated
  relative to the deposit of the selected API key, allowing for rules that adapt
  to your account size.

## Violation Log and Alerts

- **Real-time Log**: All rule violations are logged in real time for your
  review.
- **Visual Cues**: Trades that violate rules are marked with a warning triangle
  ⚠️, prompting immediate attention.

### Note: The system is designed to inform rather than enforce; it will not

interfere with your ongoing trades on the exchange. It's a prompt for you to
take action based on the pre-defined rules you've set for risk management.
