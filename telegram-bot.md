### Step 1: Add the Bot to Your Group

First, you need to add the bot to your Telegram group. Search for the bot’s
username `@TraderMakeMoneyBot` in Telegram and add it to your group.

### Step 2: Set the Bot as Admin

For the bot to function correctly, you must set it as an admin in the group
settings. This allows the bot to read messages and send notifications.

### Step 3: Initiate the Connection

> **Important**: Ensure that you are not using Telegram's anonymous feature to
> send the message. The connection message must be sent from your personal
> Telegram account to establish the link correctly.

Once the bot is an admin, send the following message in your group to initiate
the connection process.

### Step 4: Confirm the Connection

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:left-panel -->

After sending the message, the bot will confirm if the connection is successful.
Ensure that you follow any additional instructions provided by the bot.
