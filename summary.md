Summary section is your comprehensive dashboard for trading analysis and
performance tracking. This section is structured to offer you maximum
flexibility and insight into your trading activities.

- **Dashboards**: Your canvas for creating a personalized dashboard. Each board
  acts as a container for various widgets that display different aspects of your
  trading data.

- **Widgets**: These are the building blocks of your boards. Each widget
  presents specific trading data, ranging from profit charts to detailed
  analytics. Customize each widget to display the exact information you need.

- **Dashboard and Widget Settings**: Fine-tune your experience by adjusting
  settings at both the board and widget levels. While board settings provide a
  general framework, widget settings allow for more granular control, enabling
  you to delve deeper into your data analysis.

This intuitive structure ensures that you have all the tools and flexibility
needed to tailor your dashboard to your unique trading strategy and preferences.

corresponding board settings for that widget. This allows for detailed
personalization of data analysis on a per-widget basis.

<!-- ## Data Analysis -->
<!---->
<!-- Read [data filtering](filters.md#filtering-in-widgets) section. -->

<!-- ### Filtering Data -->

<!-- presets for quick application in future analyses. -->

<!-- The 'Grouping Date' setting allows you to align data visualization with your -->
<!-- trades. By default, data is grouped by the 'Open Time' of trades. For long-term -->

<!-- to accurately reflect the trade impact on your analytics. -->

## Privacy and Sharing

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:left-panel -->

When sharing your analytics, you may wish to keep exact numbers confidential.

## Real-Time Updates

### Refreshing Data

Data is calculated in real-time, but widgets require manual refreshing to update
with the latest data. Use the `REFRESH DATA` button to ensure you are viewing
the most current information.

### Automatic Time-Based Updates

Configure widgets to update automatically by setting time presets such as '7
days' or 'Current day'. These widgets will then refresh their data daily to
display the latest information based on the selected time frame.
