# Your Guide to analyzing trades

Welcome to the 'My Trades' section, where you'll see a list of your trades
sorted by the opening date. Open trades on the exchange are always listed first.

Unlike the 'Summary' section where you analyze your overall trading, here you
can delve into each trade individually.

#### Recording Entry Reasons

Every trade has a reason behind its execution. Regularly recording this reason
helps you identify effective and ineffective trading strategies. It also
prevents you from making trades without a solid reason.

#### Utilizing Entry Reason Tags

Use the 'Entry Reasons' column for short, repetitive tags. By creating your set
of tags, you'll gradually move away from manually typing reasons to selecting
from your personalized list.

#### Detailed Trade Analysis

In-depth analysis of individual trades is a crucial step in any trader's
development. Therefore, completing the description and conclusion for each trade
is an essential task.

This approach in 'My Trades' allows you to dissect your trading habits and
decisions on a granular level, leading to more informed and disciplined trading
strategies.

  place of values.
- To access these locked columns, consider upgrading to a plan that includes
  them.

## MAE and MFE

#### MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion)

- **What is MAE?**: Measures how far the price moved against your position
  during the trade.
- **How it's Calculated**: Evaluates the worst price point relative to your
  first entry point (lowest for longs, highest for shorts).

#### MFE (Maximum Favorable Excursion)

- **What is MFE?**: Calculates the maximum potential profit during a trade.
- **Calculation Method**: Identifies the best price point from your entry
  (highest for longs, lowest for shorts).

#### Calculation Specifics and Limitations

- **Timeframe**: Derived from the 1-minute chart.
- **Limitation**: Trades under 1 minute are not included.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans to upgrade to second-chart data for more
  detailed analysis.

MAE and MFE are key metrics for assessing risk and potential profit, helping
traders, especially beginners, make informed decisions.

## Trade Lifecycle

### Futures Market

- **Starting a Trade**: A trade begins with a buy or sell order.
- **Accumulating**: Additional orders on the same side are added to the open
  trade.
- **Closing a Trade**: Opposite side orders close the position.

**Example**:

1. Buy 2 BTC
2. Buy additional 1 BTC
3. Sell 1 BTC (position is now 2 BTC)
4. Sell 2 BTC (trade closes).

### Spot Market

- **Initiating Trades**: Starts with a buy or sell and accumulates further
  orders on the same side.
- **Automatic Closure**: System closes the trade if "dust" remains due to
  minimum order sizes.
- **Manual Closure**: The "Close Trade" button allows you to close trades with
  residual amounts.

**Example**:

1. Buy 100 XRP
2. Buy 50 XRP more
3. Sell 120 XRP (30 XRP remains)
4. Sell 30 XRP or manually close if the amount is too small to trade ("dust").

**Manual Closing Note**: Closing a trade manually without any sell orders moves
it to the archive, as it's classified as a conversion.

Use "Close Trade" cautiously; it's a permanent action with immediate effect on
trade categorization.
